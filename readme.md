# IsoStore

A simplistic isomorphic key-value store with a Map-like API for persisting data.

## Backends

The following stores are provided:

- `AbstractStore`: A generic store with no backend, for using a custom persistence mechanism.
- `MemoryStore`: An in-memory store, useful if you don't need persistance, but just want to use the same API.
- `LocalStore`: A store for persisting data reliably and indefinitely.
  - Node: it will atomically write a file to disk, in a path that depends on your OS.
  - Browser: it will use the `localStorage` API.
- `SessionStore`: A store per persisting data somewhat unreliably and/or not indefinitely.
  - Node: it will non-atomically write a temp file to disk, which could be deleted at any time.
  - Browser: it will use the `sessionStorage` API.

All provided stores are not intended for performance use cases, since the entire store is saved when any change is made in it.

When instantiating multiple stores of the same type and with the same id you'll actually always receive the same instance back.

Only alphanumeric store ids are allowed.

## Install

```sh
npm install --save isostore
```

## Usage

```ts
import {AbstractStore, LocalStore, MemoryStore, SessionStore} from 'isostore';

// Creating a local store, for indefinite persistence

const store = new LocalStore ( 'my-store' ); // The id of the store decides the name of the file on disk

store.has ( 'foo' ); // => false
store.set ( 'foo', 'some_string' ); // => store
store.get ( 'foo' ); // => 'some_string'
store.delete ( 'foo' ); // => true

// Creating another local store, with the same id

const store2 = new LocalStore ( 'my-store' );

console.log ( store === store2 ); // => true, with ðŸŒˆ magic ðŸŒˆ

// Creating a session store, for temporary persistence

const store3 = new SessionStore ( 'my-store' );

// Creating an in-memory store, for no persistence

const store4 = new MemoryStore ();

// Creating a custom store, with a custom backend

const MY_BACKEND = {
  read ( id ) {
    // Return a [string, string][]
  },
  write ( id, entries ) {
    // Write the entries to disk
  }
};
```
